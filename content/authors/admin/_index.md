I'm a political scientist working on crisis politics and institutional trust. I am currently a Research Fellow at the European University Institute, working in the SOLID Project (Policy Crisis and Crisis Politics Sovereignty, Solidarity and Identity in the EU Post 2008. PI's: Hanspeter Kriesi, Waltraud Schelkle, Maurizio Ferrera).

My research received the 2024 Gordon Smith and Vincent Wright Memorial Prize in West European Politics. In addition, my research can be found in the Journal of Political Behavior, the British Journal of Political Science, the Journal of European Public Policy, and Oxford and Cambridge University Press, among others. I received my PhD from Central European University in September 2019. I was previously a Max Weber Fellow and part-time Assistant Professor at the European University Institute, teaching quantitative methods.
