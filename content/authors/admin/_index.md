I'm a political scientist working on crisis politics and institutional trust. I am currently a Ramon y Cajal Fellow (tenure-track) at the Institute for Public Goods and Policies (IPP) at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) in Madrid. 

Previously, I was a Research Fellow at the European University Institute, working in the [SOLID Project](https://solid-erc.eu/). I was also a Max Weber Fellow and part-time Assistant Professor at the European University Institute, teaching quantitative methods. I received my PhD from Central European University in 2019. 

My research received the 2024 Gordon Smith and Vincent Wright Memorial Prize in West European Politics. In addition, my research can be found in the Journal of Political Behavior, the British Journal of Political Science, the Journal of European Public Policy, and Oxford and Cambridge University Press, among others.
